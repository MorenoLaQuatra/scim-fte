# Understanding the value of full-text article exploration in citation analysis

This repository contains the binary classification output of different machine learning models for the task of scientific citation classification.

We propose a classification approach to automatically predicting whether the article full-text contains a relevant amount of similar content beyond abstract and title. The proposed approach could support researchers in understanding the added value of full-text article exploration, compared to a quick glance of the very preliminary sections of the paper.
